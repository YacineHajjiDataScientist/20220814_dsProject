Preprocessing:
Issues:
-pd.get_dummies is not done on some variables (when these variables have numbers instead of categories)
-nos types de variables ne sont pas okay

xgboost: launched with NAs on a lot of variables
Issues:
-I have the wrong results with classification_report
-I have the wrong samples with classification_report

glm: launched without NA, without correlated variables, without modalities that can't be taken into account

We should
1-finish dmng of variables to Grp
2-transform each variable in the right format
3-check relation of each variable vs outcome in final dataset
4-check relation of each variable vs other ones in final dataset
5-build datasets ready for specific ML methods
6-launch ML methods
7-tunning ML methods
